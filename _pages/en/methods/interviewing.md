### What is interviewing?
Interviewing is asking people a series of questions and asking for their response.

### Key elements of usability testing

### 1. Ask productive questions.

[Steve Portigal offers](https://portigal.com/seventeen-types-of-interviewing-questions/) the following palette of useful questions:
* **Ask about sequence** “Describe a typical workday. What do you do when you first sit down at your station?-Then what do you do next?”
* **Ask about quantity** “How many files would you delete when that happens?”
* **Ask for specific examples** “What is the last movie that you streamed?” – Compare this to “What movies do you stream?” The specific is easier to answer than the general and becomes a platform for follow up questions.
* **Ask for the complete list** “What are all the different apps you have installed on your smartphone?” – This requires a series of follow up questions, e.g., “What else?” because few people will be able to generate an entire list of something with some prompting.
* **Ask about relationships** “How do you work with new vendors?” – This general question is especially appropriate when you don’t even know enough to ask a specific question (e.g. in comparison to the earlier example about streaming movies). Better to start general than to be presumptive with a too-specific question.
* **Ask about organizational structure** “Who does that department report to?”

### Questions to probe on what’s unsaid
* **Ask for clarification** “When you refer to “that” you are talking about the newest server, right?”
* **Ask about code words/native language** “Why do you call it the ‘Batcave?'”
* **Ask about emotional cues** “Why do you laugh when you mention ‘Best Buy?'”
* **Ask why** “I’ve tried to get my boss to adopt this format, but she just won’t do it-” “Why do you think she hasn’t?”
* **Probe delicately** “You mentioned a difficult situation that changed your usage. Can you tell us what that situation was?”
* **Probe without presuming** “Some people have very negative feelings about Twitter, while others don’t. What is your take?” – Rather than the direct “What do you think about Twitter?” or “Do you like Twitter?” this question introduces options that aren’t tied to the interviewer or the interviewee.
* **Explain to an outsider** “Let’s say that I’ve just arrived here from another decade, how would you explain to me the difference between smartphones and tablets?”
* **Teach another** “If you had to ask your son to operate your system, how would you explain it to him?”

### 2. Listen to what people say (the "rapport engine").
*   Ask your question and then stop.
*   Maintain eye contact and open body language.
*   Show you are listening.
 *   Ask follow-up questions.
 *   Reference earlier statements. "Earlier you said that…"
 *   Circle back when necessary. "I want to go back to what you said earlier."
*   Be careful about your body language (like nodding) and sounds (like "mmm-hmm"). You want to balance encouraging participants with seeming like you're judging their statements.
*   Be selective about when you talk about yourself or your opinions. Remember, this interview is about them, not you.
*   Avoiding interrupting. Let there be a little bit of silence. 



### 3. Manage the flow.
*   Progress between phases:
 *   Warming up
 *   Establishing the basics
 *   Diving deeper
 *   Key questions
 *   Summing up
 *   Reflecting and verifying
*   When you're changing topic, say so.
*   Let participants be winding and pick up disparate threads later.
*   Let participants know what your goal or "arc" for the session is.
*   Give people an out if they get uncomfortable.
*   Give people an opportunity to ask their own questions as well. Those questions can be revealing.

### 4. Don't only ask questions.

_Instead, ask people to:_
*   Complete tasks.
*   Get reactions to a sketch, website or objects.
*   Sequence cards or sticky notes that represent their experience.
*   Write down a few key points.
*   If you can watch them complete a task.

### 5. Look for patterns, not outliers.
*   Use as close to verbatim notes as you can.
*   Focus on what you heard most frequently, not what was most interesting.
*   Talk about the diversity of answers, not just the most memorable one.
*   Come to conclusions, then analyze again.
*   Don't analyze alone.

### Tips for conducting interviews at CDS
* Follow our [guidelines for respecting participants' privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy). Work with our policy team to create an ATIP-approved consent form before you get started. Speak to the policy analyst on your product team or ask Colin for more help.
* Interviewing, as part of user research, is generally exempt from [Government of Canada Public Opinion Research regulation](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/public-opinion-research-government.html#toc3). But follow [our POR tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/por) to steer clear of potential problems.
* You can use our [equipment]({{ site.baseurl}}/research-kit) and/or [listening room]({{ site.baseurl }}/research-room) for interviews.
