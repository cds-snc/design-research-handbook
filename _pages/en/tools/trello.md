*We use Trello to track internal projects for the Research Community of Practice.*

### How to find Trello
- Log into Trello via your CDS Google account.
- View our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/N1rwTMZs/research-community-central).
- If you need to be able to edit cards, ask Colin for an invitation.

### What we put on Trello
Trello is where we track basic information about ongoing, *non-product-specific projects*. We track information like:
- The name of the project (example: "updating the consent form generator")
- Who's taking the lead on it
- Notes on project progress

### What we don't put on Trello
Like Google Drive or Airtable, Trello can't hold [protected data]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy). Store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs) or our [secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/protected-files).

### Who uses Trello when
- **Researchers are responsible for updating their project cards.**
- Enter projects as you start working on them.
- Update the project card as you do work on the project.
- Move it to the "done" column when you're done with it.

### Why do we do this?
Trello serves three purposes:
- It keeps us abreast of each others work. It saves others from asking what you're doing, when.
