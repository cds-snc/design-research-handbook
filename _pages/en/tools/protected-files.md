*We put papers with protected personal information in a secure filing cabinet.*

### How to find the protected filing cabinet
Ask any researcher for the location of the secure filing cabinet in your office. They'll also know how to operate the lock.

### What we put in the protected filing cabinet
Any printed material that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Raw research notes
- Research session recordings
- Job interviewee notes or evaluations

### What we don't put in the cabinet
- You can store papers that aren't protected at your desk or in your locker.
- You can store protected, online information in [GC Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs).
- Any non-protected files can go on [Google Drive]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive).
- Classified (like "secret" or "topic secret" documents) can't go in any of our systems or filing cabinets. Refer to TBS' guidance on handling it.

### Who uses the cabinet when
- **You are responsible for returning materials to the cabinet as soon as you're done using them.**
- You also need to make sure that it's locked when you're done using it.
