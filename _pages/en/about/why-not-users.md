These word choices seem minor, but they subtly influence what we do. They also signal our maturity to our peers and job candidates.

Let’s try to say…
- *“usability testing” instead of “user testing.”* User testing implies we’re testing the users (we’re not). User testing also sounds like "user acceptance testing," which is not the same thing.

- *“people” instead of “users.”* Why? 
    * People are more than users of our systems. When we refer to them as users, it's easy to forget their other, more important identities. 
    * Users is an imprecise word. Which users? The public? The civil servants who support the system?
- *“human-centred design” instead of “user-centred design.”* If we try to avoid saying users, we should also use the alternative to “user-entered design.”

- *design research* instead of *user research*.” If we try to avoid saying users, we should also use the alternative to “user research."

These aren’t absolute rules. There are still situations where it helps us to say “users,” “user-centred design.” But let’s be mindful of their downsides and alternatives.
