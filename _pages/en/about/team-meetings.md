* **One-on-ones with Colin weekly**
 * Attendees: You and Colin
 * Frequency: Every other week
 * Purpose: Touch base on your OKR progress and blockers facing your work
 * Length: Half an hour
 * Standing agenda:
 * Blockers facing your product's research
 * Progress on your OKRs
 * Whatever else you'd like to discuss

* **Team lunch monthly** Optional. We go out to lunch every month or so as a team to chat without a set agenda.

* **Team retreat quarterly** We meet for 4-5 hours toward the end of each quarter to reflect and plan for the next. See the [objectives setting process]({{ site.baseurl }}/vision-objectives) page for more details.

### Communication channels

* [#research-team on Slack](https://gcdigital.slack.com/messages/GD4QR095W/details/) is a private channel with only researchers. We use this channel for communications relevant only to us. Even though it's hidden, an access to information request could make it public. [#designresearch on Slack](https://gcdigital.slack.com/messages/GD4QR095W/details/) is a channel for anyone interested in design research. We use this channel for any discussion (related to research) CDS might enjoy.
* We use *email* very little for communication amongst our team. Slack is a better bet.
